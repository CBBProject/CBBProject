This directory contains the source code canvas that will be used for
the programming project of the CBB master. 

There are two levels at which programs can be written:

1 - At a library level using a set of libraries dealing with maths, images or
    some utilitaries.

2 - At a user interface level using the dtk framework that allows to easily
    combine various functionalities wrapped into plugins in a more complex
    application.
