Repare BilinearInterpolation2D

Add something to deal with image formats that are architecture dependent...
First idea, finish GenericCheck by making it autoconfed, but this may not
be sufficient. Second idea, extend the example syntax (maybe not even
necessary since this can be done for files containing the suffix for the
images that are affected) to replace the crude comparison by a more flexible
one. Maybe both ideas should be implemented...

Autoconfigure GenericCheck, in particular the srcdir.
